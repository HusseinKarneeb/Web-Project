        <dd>A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even</br>
          light can not get out.the gravity is so strong because matter has been</br>
          squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.</br>
          Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes.They are </br>
          invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes.</br>
          The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes</br>

        <dd> Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black </br>
          holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but</br>
          have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or "stuff,"</br>
          in an object. Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can</br>
          be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many </br>
          stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the</br>
          Milky Way. The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black</br>
          holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists </br>
          have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole</br>
          at its center.The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way </br>
          galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns</br>
          and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths. </br> </dd>

          star that blastspart of the star into space. Scientists think supermassive black </br>

          will not fall into a black hole because no black hole is close enough to the solar</br>
          system for Earth to do that . Even if a black hole the same mass as the sun were </br>
          to take the place of the sun, Earth still would not fall in. The black hole would</br>
          have the same gravity as the sun.Earth and the other planets would orbit the black</br>
          hole as they orbit the sun now. The sun will never turn into a black hole. The sun</br>
          is not a big enough star to make a black hole.</br></dd>

      </dt>
      
      <dd class="main-definition">white hole is a hypothetical region of spacetime and singularity which cannot be
        entered from the outside,
        although energy-matter, light and information can escape from it. In this sense, it is the reverse of a black
        hole,
        which can be entered only from the outside and from which energy-matter, light and information cannot escape.
        White holes appear in the theory of eternal black holes. In addition to a black hole region in the future,
        such a solution of the Einstein field equations has a white hole region in its past.
        However, this region does not exist for black holes that have formed through gravitational collapse,
        nor are there any observed physical processes through which a white hole could be formed.

        <h2 class="header4">White holes in theoretical base</h2>
      </dt>
      <dd>While general relativity describes white holes in theory, no one knows how one might actually form.,
        A black hole cordons off its bit of space when a star collapses into a tiny volume, but playing this,
        video backwards doesn't make physical sense. An event horizon exploding into a functional star
        would, look a bit like an egg unscrambling itself a violation of the statistical law demanding that the,
        universe gets messier over time.,</br>
        Even if large white holes did form, they probably wouldn't hang around too long. Any outgoing matter,
        would collide with the matter in orbit, and the system would collapse into a black hole. "A long-lived,
        white hole, I think, is very unlikely," said Hal Haggard, a theoretical physicist at Bard College in,
        New York.

      <div class="white4">

        <p>This visualization shows a jet blasting from a black hole near the speed of light. In theory, a white hole
          looks similar to a black hole, but instead of sucking matter in, a white hole pushes matter away.
        </p>
      </div>
      <dt>
        <h2 class="header4">Do white holes exists ?</h2>
      </dt>
      <dd> The question of whether white holes exist is fraught with challenges. No observational evidence directly
        supports the existence of such objects in the observable universe.

        However, theoretical physics offers scenarios where white holes could theoretically appear. One possibility is
        during cosmic inflation, or a "big bang," in the early universe, where extreme expansion might have stretched
        regions of space-time to create white holes.

        Another intriguing idea is the big bounce theory, which suggests our universe began as a white hole formed from
        the remnants of a collapsing parent universe </dd>

      <div class="white2">

      </div>

      <dt>
        <h2 class="header4">The ultimate white hole </h2>
      </dt>
      <dd>Alternatively, the aftermath of a white hole may exist everywhere. To black hole physicists, the Big Bang's
        explosion
        of matter and energy looks like potential white hole behavior. "The geometry is very similar in the two cases,"
        Haggard said.
        "Even to the point of being mathematically identical at times."

        Cosmologists call this picture the "the Big Bounce," and some seek characteristic white hole features in the
        universe's earliest< observable light. Rovelli also wonders if violent radio bursts represent the cries of
          theoretical mini black holes left over from the Big Bang as they make an early transition into white holes
          (although this explanation appears increasingly unlikely). The universe may not contort itself into all the
          shapes general relativity allows, but Haggard thinks physicists should follow this rabbit hole all the way to
          the end. "Why wouldn't you investigate whether they [white holes] have interesting consequences,
       " he
          said. "It may be that those consequences aren't what you expected, but it would be foolhardy to ignore them."
